I still have to work on one thing: loading the contents from XML file on document load.
I've managed to write contents into the xml file using php. The file manipulations and data passing were challenging and took most of my time.

The flow of our application can be like this:
Load the contents from the xml file and populate the table on document load. A new task when added, is written to the xml file each time but the table is populated with the values from the form. Thus the xml file is only read to get the contents the first time after document load. 

Kindly make changes in the form.php file!!

Please make a note that I've changed the form name. You can merge the changes with the main project. I'l just figure out how to load data on doc load and push the code.  
 
I'm very sorry for if the code seems confusing. I'll fix it as early as possible.
